# Many-Valued-Modal-Tableau
This repo contains the implementation of a desicion procedure for checking the validity of many-valued modal logic formulas. It is based on a generalisation of Fitting's prefixed tableau system presented in [*Proof Methods for Modal and Intuitionistic Logics*](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-2794-5).
